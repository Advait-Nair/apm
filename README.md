# apm (Adva Package Manager)

Adva Package Manager, abbreviated to apm, is a complete, localised file duplication, tracking and managing system that allows users to streamline, speed up and centralise their workflow. It utilises a CLI (Command Line Interface) from which the apm software can be easily accessed.

# Documentation

## HOW IT WORKS

APM allows you to create 'components', also known as 'modules', which are files you upload to APM. Think of this file as the source file. You can upload as many as you want.

These modules can then be 'loaded' onto a working directory. This means that you take one of your components, duplicate it and insert it into your directory.

What APM does for you is that it allows you to perform this operation with ease. Once you have loaded a file, it will have to be managed and monitored.

Take this example: A component file had a mistake or error inside it, thus you need to update it. This file was used in quite a few projects, thus what APM allows you to do is update the version of each file, as well as the version of other files and what needs to be changed.

This is just a taste of what APM lets you do.
